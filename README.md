# Stevies-Schedule

Description
* This week we were tasked with making a working schedule that told the time of the day and also the month date and year. Then the time that was in the past be grey the time in the present is red and the future time is green. Then we had to have a working save button that would save the text to localstorage and keep the text there even after a page refresh.
